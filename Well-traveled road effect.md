 Tendency to think that traveling to an unfamiliar place has taken longer - but an equal time journey in very familiar route would feel shorter.

### Cause

 It is hypothesised that drivers use less cognitive effort when traversing familiar routes and therefore underestimate the time taken to traverse the familiar route.

### Consequences

 This effect creates errors when estimating the most efficient route to an unfamiliar destination, when one candidate route includes a familiar route, whilst the other candidate route includes no familiar routes.
