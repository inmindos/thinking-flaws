Tendency to believe that individuals are more attractive when they are in a group.

### Cause

This effect arises due to the interplay of three cognitive phenomena:

- The human visual system takes "ensemble representations" of faces in a group.
- Perception of individuals is biased towards this average.
- Average faces are more attractive, perhaps due to "averaging out of unattractive idiosyncracies".
