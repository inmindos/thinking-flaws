Reactance is the resistance we feel when there is a threat to our behavioral freedom. This can be triggered when there is heavy pressure to accept a view or attitude. This will result in increased resistance to pressure(Extreme example - [[Backfire effect]]).

The more we value the behavioral freedom that was threatened, the stronger reactance we feel.

### Consequences

[[Reverse psychology]] uses this effect.
