More weightage is given to a recent event/data/evidence when compared to past events/data/evidence. Eg., it convinces us that a rising market or individual stock will continue to appreciate, or that a declining market or stock is likely to keep falling. 

### Consequences

This bias often leads us to make emotionally charged choices.
