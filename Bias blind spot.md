It's more difficult to notice biases in ourselves.

### Cause

People are motivated to view themselves in a positive light and judge themselves as being rational, accurate, and free of bias.

### Consequences

This may be a source of conflict and misunderstanding between people. One may attribute another's bias to "intentional malice" while discounting one's own bias as good intention.
