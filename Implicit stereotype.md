We assign certain qualities to a member of an out group. This happens automatically and without thought. This can be because of our own experience or learned association of qualities to out-group qualifiers(eg. race, class, gender, etc.)

In contrast, there is is also **Explicit** stereotype - they are more conscious and intentional.
