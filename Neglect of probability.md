excerpt: "Tendency to ignore probability when making decisions in uncertain conditions."
---

Tendency to ignore probability when making decisions in uncertain conditions. Small risks are either ignored or over exaggerated. Eg. Risk of death due to nuclear power plant failure.

### Cause

We have no intuitive grasp of risk and thus distinguish poorly among different threats. We also lack an intuitive grasp of probability.

### Consequences

Creates unwarranted fear. Neglect of probability also figures in the purchase of lottery tickets.
