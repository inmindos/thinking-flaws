Philosophical view that all things have a set of properties that are necessary to their identity. Comes from Plato - all things have an "essence".

Believing that social identities, such as ethnicity, nationality or gender, are the necessary characteristics of people which define who they are, can lead to dangerous consequences. Essentialist thinking lies at the core of many discriminatory and extremist ideologies.
