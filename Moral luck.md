Assigning praise or blame of an action based on outcome even if its not fully in their control. 

### Example

Two people drunk drove - one killed a child. We assign that one more blame even if both did the same action - and the person who killed the child was not in full control of their reactions.

### Cause

Society is set up in its own interest to protect the community and hence blame is assigned for harm caused.
