If we put in a lot of effort into something, its value will go up in our mind.

### Example

If we put in a lot of effort to cook something, it will feel more tasty.

### Consequence

Hazing/Ragging rituals comes from this. If the rite of passage has difficult/humiliating task, the person undergoing it will increase the value for the group to justify the effort.
