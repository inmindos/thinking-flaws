A belief that good/bad things happen to us because of external influences rather than personal actions. Eg. I got good marks because the teacher likes me.

### Cause

People typically underestimate their capacity to generate satisfaction with future outcomes. When people experience such self-generated satisfaction, they may mistakenly conclude that it was caused by an influential, insightful, and benevolent external agent. 

### Consequences

Belief in omniscient, omnipotent, and benevolent external agents, such as God.
