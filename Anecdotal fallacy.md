We believe that personal experience/anecdotal examples trumps data or logical argument. Eg.,if you know someone who smokes and lived to a ripe old age, you might be less likely to take seriously the health risks of smoking.

### Cause

Its easier to accept an idea provided by someone than doing the work yourself.
