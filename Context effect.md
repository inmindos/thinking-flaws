We might not be able to recall information without memory aids/cues that we used at study. Cognition and memory is dependent on context.

### Cause

Information stored in the human memory is retrieved by way of association with other memories. Some memories can not be recalled by simply thinking about them. Rather, one must think about something associated with it.
