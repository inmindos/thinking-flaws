A previous "good" behaviour will make it easier to do "bad" behaviour. Eg. I just exercised, so I can have a pizza.

### Consequences

Self-licensing can have negative societal consequences since it has a permissive effect on behaviours such as racial prejudice and discrimination, selfishness, poor dietary and health habits, and excessive energy consumption.
