Less likely to spend a large denomination currency than the equal value in smaller notes.

### Cause

The denomination effect can occur when large denominations are perceived as less exchangeable than smaller denominations. 

### Consequences

- Large denomination can serve as a mechanism to prevent the urge to spend.
- Studies suggest the influence of denomination on spending decisions has implications on consumer welfare and monetary policy. Offering smaller denominations could encourage spending.
