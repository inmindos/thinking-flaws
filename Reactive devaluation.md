Tendency to devalue ideas/proposals that comes from an "enemy".

### Example

In US, more people favored an arms deal if they were told it was proposed by the US than if they were told it came from the Russian side.

### Cause

- [[Loss aversion]]
- Attitude polarization: a disagreement becomes more extreme as the different parties consider evidence on the issue.
- [[Naive realism]]
