Belief that people will get what they deserve. Or Everything happens for a reason.

### Cause

The belief in a just world is crucially important for people to maintain for their own well-being. But people are confronted daily with evidence that the world is not just: people suffer without apparent cause. People use strategies to eliminate threats to their belief in a just world. An irrational strategy is to blame the victim for their suffering.

### Consequences

Individuals experience less personal vulnerability because they do not believe they have done anything to deserve or cause negative outcomes.
