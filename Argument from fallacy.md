The idea that since an argument had a logical fallacy in it, it must be false. Eg. Even if the argument had a slippery slope fallacy in it, it might be true.(In a slippery slope argument, a course of action is rejected because, with little or no evidence, one insists that it will lead to a chain reaction resulting in an undesirable end or ends.)
