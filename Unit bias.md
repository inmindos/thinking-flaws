We want to finish a unit of anything we are consuming - we don't want to stop in the middle.

You can decide to use smaller units to cut down on consumption.

### Example

- People try to finish all the food in the plate even if they are full
- We stop reading book at the end of the chapter.

### Consequences

- To increase consumption, companies have increased the unit size given. 
- Digital Apps have used Pseudo Sets of related actions(collect 10 stones) to push people to do more.
