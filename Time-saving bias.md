We underestimate time saved when moving from a relatively smaller speed to higher speed(eg. 30kmph to 40kmph). Also, we overestimate time saved when moving from a relatively faster speed to even faster speed(eg. 70-100kmph).

### Cause

People falsely believe that journey time decreases somewhat linearly as driving speed increases, irrespective of the initial speed, causing the time-saving bias.


### Consequences

The time-saving bias is not limited to driving. The same faulty estimations emerge when people are asked to estimate savings in patientsâ€™ waiting time when adding more physicians to a health care center or when estimating an increase in the productivity of a manufacturing line by adding more workers.
