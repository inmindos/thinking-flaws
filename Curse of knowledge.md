When communicating with others, we assume that they have all the background information about the topic that we have already. Eg. when teaching others, the teacher can't understand why it's so difficult for the student to get it when it's so simple for themselves.


### Consequences

- The curse of expertise may be counterproductive for learners acquiring new skills.
- It can also show up in computer programming where the programmer fails to produce understandable code, e.g. comment their code, because it seems obvious at the time they write it. But a few months later they may have no idea why the code exists.
