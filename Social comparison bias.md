We have a feeling of dislike and competitiveness towards people who we think are better than us. We automatically compare others against ourselves to know where we stand in the social hierarchy.

Social media has a huge role to play in this.

### Consequences

- Feelings of inferiority/ reduced self esteem
- Increased anxiety
- This can lead to depression in extreme cases. 
- Coping behaviours(eg. substance abuse, self harm, eating disorder, etc.)
