Hard tasks makes you overconfident - and predict higher success probability while easier tasks makes you under confident - and predict lower success. 

Note: This effect has been [disputed](http://home.cerge-ei.cz/ortmann/TrentoCourse/Juslin_etal_Naive_Empiricism_Dogmatism_inConfidence_Research.pdf) by some researchers.

### Example

When answering a hard question the student is sure that they'll get the answer correctly - and opposite for an easy question.
