Favouring people of your in-group over people outside.

### Cause

Studies have shown that in-group favouritism arises as a result of the formation of cultural groups. Intergroup competition for scarce resources or psychological drive for distinct social identities leads to in-group favouring.

### Consequences

- A tendency of strong national zeal.
