If an unlikely event(that's statistically independent) occurred multiple times, it's less likely to occur in the future. Eg. A dice that rolled 6 multiple times will not roll more 6-s.

### Cause

Gambler's fallacy relies more on the prefrontal cortex, which is responsible for executive, goal-directed processes, and less on the brain areas that control affective decision-making.
