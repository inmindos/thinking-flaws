If we see an innovation at work, we tend to believe that it can be applied everywhere without need of alterations. This is especially true if the people who made the innovation are still around and championing the idea.

### Cause

The innovation's "champion" has such strong bias in favor of the innovation, that he/she may not see its limitations or weaknesses and continues to promote it nonetheless.

### Consequences
Leads to overly exaggerated predictions about the applications of new innovations.
