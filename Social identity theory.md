Social identity is the part of a person's self-concept that is made from their membership in a social group.

Social Identity theory tries to explain inter-group behaviors as a result of...
- difference in status within the group
- legitimacy and stability of the status differences
- ability to move to another group

### Consequences

- [[In-group bias|Ingroup Favoritism]]
- Help other people in the group
- Reluctance to bet against the group even if they are negatively affected by it.
