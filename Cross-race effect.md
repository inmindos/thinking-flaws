Tendency to recognize faces from your own race more easily when compared to recognizing faces from other races.

### Cause

The cross-race effect is thought to contribute to difficulties in cross-race identification, as well as implicit racial bias. Outgroup members may not notice the subtle variations in skin tone, lip size, or brow strength that ingroup members recognize. Cross-race effect actually has less to do with race than with different levels of cognitive processing that occur for ingroup and outgroup members.


### Consequences

- The cross-race effect is thought to contribute to difficulties in cross-race identification, as well as implicit racial bias.
- Research has shown, that when making financial decisions, specific facial characteristics and implicit bias can influence the perceived trustworthiness of another person.
