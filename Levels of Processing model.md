We tend to remember things that has more depth of mentally processing. Just a read thru is considered shallow processing, while reading, thinking and taking notes(like in [[Zettelkasten]]) is considered more deeper processing.

This type of processing will create a better "memory trail". The item to remember will be connected to more points in the brain - and with a stronger connection - making recall easier.
