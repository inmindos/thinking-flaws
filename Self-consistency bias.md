We believe that we are consistent in our beliefs, behaviors, options, attitudes, etc. This is a memory bias. 

### Example

We might go on a blind date and not being thrilled about the date. But years later we'll tell people how amazing that date was after you've fallen in love with the person.

### Consequences

Our decisions can substantially change our immediate memory of what we have just perceptually experienced in an attempt to make our experience consistent with our preceding decisions.
