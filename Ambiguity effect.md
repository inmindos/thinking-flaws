We prefer options with known probability over options with unknown probability even if the payout is smaller in the known option. Eg. preferring to invest in government bonds over stocks because of unpredictability in stock market - even though it gives a higher return in the long run.

### Cause

People have a tenancy to avoid options with missing information.
