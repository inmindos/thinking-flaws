We think other people can understand our mental state fairly accurately. And we think we are very accurate about our guess of another person's mental state.

### Consequences

The illusion of transparency is commonly prominent in public speakers. The speaker has an exaggerated sense of how obvious his or her nervousness about a speech is to the audience. The speaker experiences immense stress.
