We underestimate time required to finish a task. Result of [[Optimism Bias]]. This only affects predictions of your own tasks. When predicting for others, we tend to have a [[Pessimism bias]]. 

### Cause

- Wishful thinking
- People make optimistic estimates so as to create a favourable impression with others

### Consequences

The planning fallacy results in not only time overruns, but also cost overruns and benefit shortfalls.
