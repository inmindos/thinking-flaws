Expecting others to be biased all the time.

### Cause

People believe that others do things for their own self-interest rather than for altruistic reasons. 

### Consequences

   - Over-thinking the actions of others.
   - Making negative attributions about others' motivations without sufficient cause.
   - Missing opportunities that greater trust might capture.
