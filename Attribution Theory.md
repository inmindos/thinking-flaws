"Attribution" is how people think the cause of their everyday experience are. These can be external or internal. There are multiple models to explain these - and the models are called Attribution Theory.

- External attribution: My behavior was caused by my environment. Eg. I was late because of traffic.
- Internal Attribution: My behavior was caused by some internal characteristics. Eg. I was late because I'm a tardy person.
