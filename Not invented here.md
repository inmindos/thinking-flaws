It is usually adopted by social, corporate, or institutional cultures.

People may not use others' work for various reasons like, to support a local economy instead of paying royalties to a foreign license-holder, fear of patent infringement, lack of understanding of the foreign work, an unwillingness to acknowledge or value the work of others, jealousy, belief perseverance, or due to a wider turf war.
