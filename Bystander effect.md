Individuals are less likely to offer help to a victim when there are other people present.

### Cause

When confronted with a potential emergency, people typically play it cool, adopt a look of nonchalance, and monitor the reactions of others to determine if a crisis is really at hand. However, because each individual holds back,  sometimes everyone concludes that the situation is not an emergency and hence does not require intervention.

### Consequences

Some parts of the world have included laws that hold bystanders responsible when they witness an emergency.
