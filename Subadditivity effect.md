Belief that probability of the whole is lesser than the sum of probabilities of the parts.

### Example

Subjects in one experiment judged the probability of death from cancer in the United States was 18%, the probability from heart attack was 22%, and the probability of death from "other natural causes" was 33%. Other participants judged the probability of death from a natural cause was 58%. Natural causes are made up of precisely cancer, heart attack, and "other natural causes," however, the sum of the latter three probabilities was 73%, and not 58%.

### Cause

Subadditivity effect can be explained by a noisy conversion of objective evidence (observation) into subjective estimates (judgment).
