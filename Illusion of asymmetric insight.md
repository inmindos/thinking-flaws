excerpt: "Belief that we know other people better than the other person knows us."

Belief that we know other people better than the other person knows us.

### Cause

This bias has been traced to people's tendency to view their own spontaneous or off-the-cuff responses to others' questions as relatively unrevealing even though they view others' similar responses as meaningful.

### Consequences

In interpersonal interactions, we believe we find out more about other people than other people find out about us.
