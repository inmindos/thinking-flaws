We believe that the views of an authority figure(Eg. God, Govt, Parent) is more accurate - and let it influence our options.

### Cause

 Individuals are motivated to view authority as deserving of their position and this legitimacy leads people to accept and obey the decisions that it makes. There is a psychological motivation for believing in the steadiness, stability and justness of the current social system.

### Consequences

- Authority bias is used as a marketing strategy in order to increase the legitimacy of claims made about a product.
- In pharmaceutical settings, non-experts blindly follow expert's commands, resulting in the distribution of harmful drugs and inappropriate healthcare practices.
-  Deference to authority can occur mindlessly as a kind of decision-making short cut.
