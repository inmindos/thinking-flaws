We want to have a sense of cognitive consistency to maintain a positive self image. 

Cognitive dissonance is how we view ideas contradictory to our existing beliefs. We might feel some psychological stress when this happens - and we will try to minimize this stress leading to a lot of behavior that might not be helpful(change behavior, justification, denial, etc).
