We tend to spend more time on figuring out trivial things rather than spending time on the important things.

### Example

A committee whose task is to create plans for a nuclear power plant might spend a disproportionate amount of time on deciding materials to use in the bike shed of the plant(hence, the name of the effect)

### Cause

People might be less inclined to comment on complex parts(like a nuclear plant) - but are confident to comment on simpler things(bike shed).
