We tend to wrongly identify the source of a memory at point of recall. This has 3 categories...

- [[Cryptomnesia]]: We can think that the idea we have was our original idea. Also known as 'inadvertent plagiarism'.
- [[False memory]]: We can "remember" things that has never happened. This can be formed after the event when hearing wrong reports about the event.
- Source confusion: We can place some input we got near the event into the event memory. Eg. There are cases where someone was watching a show on tv before they were attacked. They remember the person in the show to be their attacker.
