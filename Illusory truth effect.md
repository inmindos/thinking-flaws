We believe incorrect information to be correct after repeated exposure. Eg. Advertising, Propaganda

Processing fluency: the ease with which information is processed.

### Consequences

 Familiarity can overpower rationality and repetitively hearing that a certain fact is wrong can affect the hearer's beliefs.
