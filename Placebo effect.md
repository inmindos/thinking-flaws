An inert pill can cure health issues if the patient believes that it will.

### Consequences

- Placebos do not appear to affect the actual diseases, or outcomes that are not dependent on a patient's perception. One exception is Parkinson's disease, where recent research has linked placebo interventions to improved motor functions.
- Withdrawal symptoms can also occur after placebo treatment.
