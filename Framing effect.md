People's choices can change based on how the question is framed or worded. 

### Example

People will select something if its advertised as 80% fat-free instead of 20% fat.

### Consequences

Susceptibility to framing effects increases with age. Older adults' lack of cognitive resources, such as flexibility in decision making strategies, may cause older adults to be influenced by emotional frames more.
