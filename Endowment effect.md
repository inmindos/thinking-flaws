We want to keep a thing we own more than we want to get the same thing when we don't own it. Eg. I might be willing to give 3$ to get a cup. But if I already own that cup, I'll ask for 7$ is someone wants to buy the cup from me.

### Cause

- [[Loss aversion]]
- We have a connection to what we own
- [[Prospect theory]]
