We judge arguments based on the probability of the conclusion rather than how strongly the argument support the conclusion. If an argument supports a conclusion that aligns with our pre-existing beliefs, we are more likely to support it.

### Example

Consider the argument that bitcoin is better than fiat currency because its there is no central authority controlling it. We are more likely to support if we believe that blockchain based currencies like bitcoins are the future. If we are faced with argument that fiat currency are better because they are not volatile, we are will reject it because of the same belief. Ideally we should be considering how strongly the argument supports the conclusion.
