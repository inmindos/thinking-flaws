We tend to have more defined and articulated goals about parts of our lives which has lower priority. Higher priority parts will have generic goals - if any.

### Example

- Low Priority: Buy screwdriver - flat head, green handle, manual. Buy by Thursday. Cost under 100 Rs.
- High Priority: Get a job.
