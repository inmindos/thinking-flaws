People don't easily change existing belief even when presented with new evidence. They over weigh existing belief and under weigh new evidence.

### Consequences

In finance, evidence has been found that investors under-react to corporate events, consistent with conservatism. This includes announcements of earnings, changes in dividends,etc.
