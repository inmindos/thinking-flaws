Concentrating on the people/things that got past a selection point. Eg. modelling your life after successful people.

### Consequences

- Survivorship bias can lead to overly optimistic beliefs because failures are ignored.
- It can also lead to the false belief that the successes in a group have some special property, rather than just coincidence.
