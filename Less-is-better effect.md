A lesser option is preferred when evaluated separately. But when evaluated together, this effect disappears.

### Examples

- A person giving a \$45 scarf (from scarves ranging from $5-$50) as a gift was perceived to be more generous than one giving a \$55 coat (from coats ranging from $50-$500)
- On overfilled ice cream serving with 7 oz of ice cream was valued more than an under-filled serving with 8 oz of ice cream
- Dinnerware set with 24 intact pieces was judged more favorably than one with 31 intact pieces (including the same 24) plus a few broken ones.
