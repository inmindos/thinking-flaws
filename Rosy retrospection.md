We judge past events more positively than we do the present. Possibly caused by nostalgia.

### Cause

Simplifications and exaggerations of memories (such as occurs in rosy retrospection) may make it easier for people's brains to store long-term memories, as removing details may reduce the burden of those memories on the brain.

### Consequences

Some people theorize that it may in part serve a useful purpose in increasing self-esteem and a person's overall sense of well-being.
