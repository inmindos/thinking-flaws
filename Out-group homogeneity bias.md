The belief that the people in the out-group are very similar to each other. "They are all alike; we are diverse."

### Cause

less attention is paid to differences between outgroup members and this leads to perceptions of outgroup homogeneity. 


### Consequences

- People of other races seem to look more alike than members of one's own race. 
- Leads to stereotyping.
